# Mindshap - Minds hap -> Mind shap
Research to understand how minds are shaped to produce a guide for how to shape fruitful minds of childs. The definition of a **hap** is something happening or that happens by chance. Our mindset is not developed by chance. It shaped by every incident that happened to us.


# Main idea
We are most of times being tortured by relatives/friends such as "we are gonna take you with us" or "we'll take your toys with us" or "what's your marks, it's lower than our daughter" ...etc and the list goes on. 

This makes us somehow hate our relatives/friends or in worst scenario, it may result into future depression or loneliness.

So, many incidents shape our mind. Our age and depth of such incidents determinates how much impact it will give to our thoughts and decisions in future and so on our life. Less the age, more is the impact and vice versa.

Some of your habits, phobias, likes/dislikes and in simple, your mindset as a whole doesn't know the reasons why you are the way you are. It can be answered if someone look deeply into your childhood and every past incident that happened to you.

So, now a question arises that What, when and how a incident must happen to a child to result into a fruitful mindset ?
